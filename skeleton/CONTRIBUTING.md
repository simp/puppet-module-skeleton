This module has grown over time based on a range of contributions from
people using it. If you follow these contributing guidelines your patch
will likely make it into a release a little quicker.


## Contributing and workflow

SIMP has it's own [Contribution Guidelines](https://simp-project.atlassian.net/wiki/display/SD/Contributing+to+SIMP). You should read them in detail, but I will summarize it here.

1. Fork the project on GitHub.

2. Make a Feature branch for you changes.

3. Make your changes!

4. Save your changes in a single commit using `git rebase` and squashing them.

5. Push your changes up to GitHub.

6. Create a Pull Request(PR) with your changes.

7. Travis CI will run tests on your PR. Make sure these tests pass.

8. Your changes will be picked up by an admin in GerritHub and your code will be reviewed. 

9. Hopefully your code will be accepted and merged!

## Dependencies

The testing and development tools have a bunch of dependencies,
all managed by [Bundler](http://bundler.io/) according to the
[Puppet support matrix](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/platforms.html#ruby-versions).

By default the tests use a baseline version of Puppet.

If you have Ruby 2.x or want a specific version of Puppet,
you must set an environment variable such as:

    export PUPPET_VERSION="~> 3.2.0"

Install the dependencies like so...

    bundle install

## Syntax and style

The test suite will run [Puppet Lint](http://puppet-lint.com/) and
[Puppet Syntax](https://github.com/gds-operations/puppet-syntax) to
check various syntax and style things. You can run these locally with:

    bundle exec rake lint
    bundle exec rake syntax

## Running the unit tests

The unit test suite covers most of the code, as mentioned above please
add tests if you're adding new functionality. If you've not used
[rspec-puppet](http://rspec-puppet.com/) before then feel free to ask
about how best to test your new feature. Running the test suite is done
with:

    bundle exec rake spec

Note also you can run the syntax, style and unit tests in one go with:

    bundle exec rake test

### Automatically run the tests

During development of your puppet module you might want to run your unit
tests a couple of times. You can use the following command to automate
running the unit tests on every change made in the manifests folder.

    bundle exec guard

## Integration tests

The unit tests just check the code runs, not that it does exactly what
we want on a real machine. For that we're using
[Beaker](https://github.com/puppetlabs/beaker).

Beaker fires up a new virtual machine (using Vagrant) and runs a series of
simple tests against it after applying the module. You can run our
Beaker tests with:

    bundle exec rake acceptance

This will use the host described in `spec/acceptance/nodeset/default.yml`
by default. To run against another host, set the `BEAKER_set` environment
variable to the name of a host described by a `.yml` file in the
`nodeset` directory. For example, to run against CentOS 6.4:

    BEAKER_set=centos-64-x64 bundle exec rake acceptance

If you don't want to have to recreate the virtual machine every time you
can use `BEAKER_destroy=no` and `BEAKER_provision=no`. On the first run you will
at least need `BEAKER_provision` set to yes (the default). The Vagrantfile
for the created virtual machines will be in `.vagrant/beaker_vagrant_files`.
